# Ray_Tracing_Speedup
•Developed an innovative approach using machine learning and computer vision to bridge the gap between ray tracing and raster rendering for enhanced image realism.

•Utilized conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to predict ray-traced render from rasterized input.

•Curated specialized dataset of mug renders for training and evaluation, exploring five model variations and analyzing performance.

•Achieved 4.5 times faster performance than traditional ray-tracing while significantly improving image quality from rasterized images.

•Assessed model fidelity through rigorous evaluation metrics, including pre-trained CNN-based discriminator and comprehensive qualitative assessments.
